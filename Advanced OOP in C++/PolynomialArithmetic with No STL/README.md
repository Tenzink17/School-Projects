Polynomial Arithmetic in canonical form using Linked List and NO STL.

What is a “canonical form”?
Answer: This is a representation where
(a) The polynomial is written from the highest powers to the lowest, and
(b) All terms with the same power are “consolidated.” If the consolidation leads to a zero
coefficient, do not display that term

Example: If the input were
-1+5x+20x^3-9x^2-2x+x^2-2x^3+x^9,
You would change it to:
x^9+18x^3-8x^2+3x-1
